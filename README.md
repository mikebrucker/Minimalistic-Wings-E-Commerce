# Minimalistic_Wings_Workshop

Day 17: 
Minimalistic Wings
Goal
To reinforce an understanding of AJAX by consuming existing data and creating an online storefront.
Learning Objectives
By the end of this exercise the student will be able to:
●	interpret and use data from external sources in their own webpage. 
●	plan out content based on requirements. 
Introduction
Red Bull has been a huge client of your digital agency, Munder Difflin. Recently you tendered a contract to build a minimal web portal for the official Red Bull store, their current website is much too heavy to be loaded fast on a slow mobile connection. 

You’re tasked with creating a clean version that lays out all their products on one page. This minimal version should adhere to their brand colors. You’ll be using the data available https://www.redbullshopus.com/products.json, this is one way that an API makes it easier to display data from one source! If they add any products, it will show up on your webpage without you having to do anything with your code!
Setup
●	Create a new folder for this project with the usual files in it: index.html, main.js, and main.css. 
●	Take the time to inspect the data at https://www.redbullshopus.com/products.json. JSONView is a great chrome extension that can help with this: https://goo.gl/9H7mhk. 
Instructions
●	Take the time to create a wireframe for how this should store should look. Remember that being mobile ready is the aim.  
●	Build out your HTML and CSS version of the product display. No need to make any ajax call yet to display all the products. This is important to make sure you understand what data you’ll be appending to the DOM from that large dataset. 
●	Now that you’ve planned what goes where, you can write the actual javascript that’ll be appending the products to the DOM. This part can be tricky, don’t be discouraged! Make an AJAX call to https://www.redbullshopus.com/products.json and append each product in the array to the page you made, replacing your placeholder products. 
●	Feel free to use any assets like logos or stock images from the main https://www.redbullshopus.com website while building, but keep it minimal. Remember to keep everything responsive! RedBull’s customers primarily use mobile phones.

Bonus:
If you made it this far, start thinking of ways you can display the categories and allow your users to only see certain items. Or how a simple search would work on the product names (the javascript filter function could be of use for that: https://goo.gl/f7MU1u). 
Completion Requirements
●	Complete workshop by end of a lot time limit.
●	The completed assignment:
○	loads products from the official RedBull store using an API call. 
○	has a responsive layout.
○	has an accompanying wireframe. 
●	Group review session for feedback and questions.
